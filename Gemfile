# Ruby Standard Library Backports
# ============================================================================
# These gems provide Ruby standard library functionality that was removed or
# reorganized in Ruby 3.0+. Required for compatibility with Jekyll and other
# dependencies that may depend on these features.

# See: https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.1.0/

# Jekyll Core & Plugins
# ============================================================================
# Note: We do NOT use the `github-pages` metagem, which bundles Jekyll with
# pinned versions of all plugins and dependencies. Instead, we manage
# dependencies manually for the following reasons:
#
# 1. Ruby 4.0+ Compatibility
#    The `github-pages` gem uses older versions of Jekyll and Liquid that
#    have compatibility issues with Ruby 3.2+ (taint-tracking removal).
#    By pinning Jekyll 3.9.0 specifically and applying patches, we maintain
#    compatibility with modern Ruby versions.
#
# 2. Fine-Grained Control
#    Managing dependencies manually allows us to update Jekyll and plugins
#    independently without waiting for GitHub to release new versions of
#    the metagem.
#
# 3. Reduced Bloat
#    We include only the plugins and features we actually need, keeping
#    the bundle smaller and easier to maintain.

# Ruby 3.2+ / Ruby 4.0+ Compatibility Patch
# ============================================================================
# Liquid 4.0.3 (required by Jekyll 3.9.0) uses Ruby's deprecated taint-tracking
# security model, which was removed in Ruby 3.2. This patch restores stub
# implementations to prevent runtime errors.
